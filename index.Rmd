## Introduction to Lipids

.pull-left[
Lipids are organic compounds that are mostly insoluble in polar solvents like water.

Example of lipids are
 * Cholesterol and Triglycerides in blood lipid panel test
 
 * Phospholipids in cell membrane
 
 * Ceramides in skin
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width = "95%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Figures showing examples where lipids can be found.\n
#| First figure on the top left is a picture of a trained medical professional drawing blood samples from a person's arm symbolising a blood lipid panel test.\n
#| Lipids like cholesterol and triglycerides are usually measured in the blood lipid panel test.\n
#| Second figure on the top right is a picture of a cell membrane displayed as a lipid bilayer made up of mainly phospholipids as well as other lipids like cholesterol and glycolipids.\n 
#| Third Figure at the bottom shows the diverse role of ceramides and its metabolite sphingoid base in skin. Ceramides can be found in the outermost layer of the skin, serving as barrier protection against chemical or microbes. At the epidermis layer of the skin, ceramides assist in the role of cell differentiation and wound healing. Finally at the dermis layer of the skin, cell signaling roles of ceramide and its metabolites modulate immunity functions in the skin."

## How Lipids are measured (Targeted Lipidomics)

```{r, out.width = "90%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Figure showing the workflow of how lipids are measured in a targeted lipidomics settings.\n
#| Samples are first converted to lipid extracts. From a given list of transitions to measure, lipids in the extracts are measured using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In the example, a transition from an internal standard Ceramide d 18 1 12 0 is measured. This results in chromatogram peaks which the user needs to 
#| integrate the area under curve.\n
#| In the case of the internal standard Ceramide d 18 1 12 0, it is four hundred and seventy nine thousand and twenty five.\n 
#| After the peaks are integrated for all samples and transtions, the peak area data are exported for further processing."

## Source of "Unwanted" Variation
* Lipid Extraction
  * Different pipettes used to do extraction.
  
* Lipid Measurement
  * Contaminant ions
  
```{r, out.width = "90%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Figure showing the stages in the targeted lipidomics settings in which
#|  unwanted or non sample related variation can occur. It is usually during the 
#|  stage of lipid extraction or measurement."

]

## Quality Control (QC) Samples

Quality control samples helps to check the severity of unwanted variation. 

One example is the Batch Quality Control (BQC) to measure variation during lipid extraction and measurement.

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Two figures showing what is a batch quality control (BQC).\n
#| Left figure shows how the BQC samples are created. They are created by first pooling the sample aliquots. 
#| The pooled sample is then aliquoted into new eppendorf tubes. These aliquoted pooled samples in the eppendorf tubes are the BQC samples.\n
#| Right figure shows where in the injection sequence are the BQC samples placed. They are usually placed before the first sample, in between samples at regular intervals, for example every five samples, and after the last sample."

]

## Quality Control Plot

An injection sequence bar chart with some statistical summary is created for each transition. Keep transitions with high BQC coefficient of variation (CV).

Report results as a pdf file of injection sequence bar charts. (One transition per page)

```{r, out.width = "90%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Figure showing an injection sequence of internal standard Ceramide d 18 1 12 0 as a bar chart.\n 
#| The y axis is peak area while the x axis is the injection sequence. The different colours on the bar chart repsresent the different QC sample type. The important ones are the ones in blue representing the BQC.\n
#| The coefficient of variation of the BQC is around 0.09 which is a low value. Hence, the internal standard Ceramide d 18 1 12 0 has a low interference from unwanted sources. This injection sequence bar chart is exported as a pdf file."

## Motivation for using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) and [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/)

Number of samples are getting larger (increase to few thousands).

Static bar charts and scatter plots will not work.

```{r, out.width = "95%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Figure showing an injection sequence of internal standard Ceramide d 18 1 12 0 as a bar chart.\n
#| The y axis is peak area while the x axis is the injection sequence. The different colours on the bar chart repsresent the different QC sample type.\n
#| A black arrow is shown at the bottom right of the plot connecting to the x-axis. The arrow highlights that the injection sequence can increase to a few thousands."

## Motivation for using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) and [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/)

Number of transitions have increased to over $500$. This give a $> 500$-pages pdf file full of plots.

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Figure showing a long transition list contaning more than 500 transitions.\n
#| The arrow on the right of the transition list leads to pictures of more than 500 injection sequence plots."

## Motivation for using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) and [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/)

Different QC sample types give rise to different plot type, resulting in .red[multiple] $> 500$-page.red[s] pdf files.

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Left figure is showing a long list of QC sample types, leading to new plots such as a raincloud plot as well as a dilution plot. This give rise to an output of many pdf files, each at least 500 pages long.\n
#| Right figure is showing a worker overwhelmed with many files of plots. The worker is carrying a sign calling for help."

## Motivation for using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) and [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/)

.pull-left[
Using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) to create interactive plots is moving in the right direction. 

However, distribution of such results to collaborators/managers remain a challenge. 

Interactive plots cannot be stored in pdf files.

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) was considered but
  * Lack expertises to maintain a secure web server to run [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) applications.
  
  * Cannot expect collaborators/managers to install/run R packages and code to rebuild the [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application just to view the results.

Summary
- Quality control samples are useful to check for unwanted variation in a targeted lipidomics workflow.

- [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) and [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/) can help to explore many interactive plots in an effective way.

- Hope that the Quarto [`r fa(name = "link")`](https://jauntyjjs.github.io/Trelliscopejs_In_Quarto_Example/) [`r fa(name = "github")`](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/Trelliscopejs_In_Quarto_Example) example and advice provided are useful.
