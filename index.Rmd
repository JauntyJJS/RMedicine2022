## How Lipids are measured (Targeted Lipidomics)

#| "Figure showing the workflow of how lipids are measured in a targeted
#| lipidomics settings. Samples are first converted to lipid extracts.
#| From a given list of transitions to measure, lipids in the extracts are 
#| measured using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In the example,
#| a transition from an internal standard Ceramide d 18 1 12 0 is measured. 
#| This results in chromatogram peaks which the user needs to 
#| integrate the area under curve. In the case of the internal standard 
#| Ceramide d 18 1 12 0, it is 479025.  
#| After the peaks are integrated for all samples and transtions,
#| the peak area data is exported for further processing."

## Quality Control (QC) Samples

Quality control samples helps to check the severity of unwanted variation. 

One example is the Batch Quality Control (BQC) to measure variation during lipid extraction and measurement.

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Two figures showing what is a batch quality control (BQC). Left figure shows
#| that BQC samples are created by first pooling the sample aliquots. The pooled
#| sample is then aliquoted into smaller amounts in new eppendorf tubes. These
#| pooled samples in the eppendorf tubes are the BQC samples. Right figure shows
#| where in the injection sequence are the BQC samples place. They are usually placed
#| in between samples at regular intervals, for example every five samples, as well as
#| before the first sample and after the last sample."

## Quality Control Plot

An injection sequence bar chart with some statistical summary is created for each transition. Keep transitions with high BQC coefficient of variation (CV).

Report results as a pdf file of injection sequence bar charts. (One transition per page)

```{r, out.width = "90%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Figure showing an injection sequence of internal standard 
#| Ceramide d 18 1 12 0 as a bar chart. The y axis is peak area while
#| the x axis is the injection sequence. The different colours on the
#| bar chart repsresent the different QC sample type. The important ones
#| are the ones in blue representing the BQC. The coefficient of variation
#| of the BQC is around 0.09 which is a low value. Hence, 
#| the internal standard Ceramide d 18 1 12 0 has a low interference from
#| unwanted sources. This injection sequence bar chart is exported as a pdf file."

## Motivation for using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) and [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/)

Number of samples are getting larger (increase to few thousands).

Static bar charts and scatter plots will not work.

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Figure showing an injection sequence of internal standard 
#| Ceramide d 18 1 12 0 as a bar chart. The y axis is peak area while
#| the x axis is the injection sequence. The different colours on the
#| bar chart repsresent the different QC sample type. A black arrow is shown
#| at the bottom right of the plot connecting to the x-axis. The arrow
#| highlights that the injection sequence can increase to a few thousands."

## Motivation for using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) and [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/)

Number of transitions have increased to over $500$. This give a $> 500$-pages pdf file full of plots.

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Figure showing a long transition list contaning more than 500 transitions.
#| The arrow on the right of the transition list leads to pictures of

## Motivation for using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) and [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/)

Different QC sample types give rise to different plot type, resulting in .red[multiple] $> 500$-page.red[s] pdf files.

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
#| fig.alt = 
#| "Left figure showing a long list of QC sample types, leading to new plots such as
#| a raincloud plot as well as a dilution plot. This give rise to an output of

## Motivation for using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) and [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/)

.pull-left[
Using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) to create interactive plots is moving in the right direction. 

However, distribution of such results to collaborators/managers remains a challenge. 

Interactive plots cannot be stored in pdf files.

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) was considered but
  * Lack expertises to maintain a secure web server to run [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) applications.
  
  * Cannot expect collaborators/managers to install/run R packages and code to rebuild the [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application just to view the results.

Use [`dplyr::mutate`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) and [`trelliscopejs::pmap_plot`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/reference/map2_plot.html) to save [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) plots as a new column.

## Patching `plotly` Plots

Use [`manipulateWidget::combineWidgets`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/manipulateWidget/vignettes/manipulateWidgets.html) and [`plotly::subplot`](https://plotly.com/r/subplots/) to patch different [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) plots.

.pull-left[

Summary
- Quality control samples are useful to check for unwanted variation in a targeted lipidomics workflow.

- [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) and [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/) can help to explore many interactive plots in an effective way.

- Hope that the Quarto [`r fa(name = "link")`](https://jauntyjjs.github.io/Trelliscopejs_In_Quarto_Example/) [`r fa(name = "github")`](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/Trelliscopejs_In_Quarto_Example) example and advice provided are useful.
